   <p>The following code should log a message that says Good morning with a dynamically entered name (from two possible variables).

 

    Either a nickname and/or firstname can be added as variables in the code. If a nickname is present it should be displayed instead of the firstname, if there is no nickname then the firstname should be shown. Unfortunately, currently, the following gets logged: Good morning, ${nickname} || {firstname}!.
    
     
    
    Please change the expression, in the console log, to behave correctly, and explain why it did not behave as expected. Furthermore, please add a state that when neither a firstname nor nickname is present only Good morning! should be logged. </p>
